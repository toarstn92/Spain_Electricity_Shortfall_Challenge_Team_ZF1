For this project, we are tasked with building and deploying a ML model and to participate in a Kaggle challenge using data provided (0_Dataset)

# Project Breakdown
* 1_EDA_and_Data_Engineering_and_Model_Creation: Explore the provided dataset, clean the data, engineer new features. Then, build an accurate regression model.

* 2_Kaggle: Use the trained ML model to participate in a Kaggle competition.

* 3_AWS_and_Flask_webserver: Deploy our trained ML model on a Flask webserver with the help of AWS.

* 4_Communication: we will present our modeling process, findings and results to a group of technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Note:

* ***The trick to succeed in this project lie in "1_EDA_and_Data_Engineering_and_Model_Creation".***

## *Good luck and have fun Team_ZF1!!*
