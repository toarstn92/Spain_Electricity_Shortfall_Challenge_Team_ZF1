# 1_EDA_and_Data_Engineering_and_Model_Creation

Build a model for the government of Spain to predict the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and energy generated with renewable sources using supervised machine learning techniques.

# Breakdown
* EDA: In the notebook *"Team_ZF1_explore_away.ipynb"*, analyse and explore provided datasets to reveal insights, patterns, correlation etc.

* Data_Engineering: Use insights gained in step one to guide data augmentation and data cleaning.

* Model Creation: Create various ML models, fitted and compared to ultimately arrive at the best model for the specific task.

Note:

* ***Code usability: In the notebook, ensure that work is fully documentated and is reproducible by a technical individual***
